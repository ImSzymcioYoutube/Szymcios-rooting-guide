# Szymcios-rooting-guide
A collection of all the things you want if you wanna root/rom your phone, zip files, apps, twrp imgs, wallpapers, etc.

It also has Magisk modules, a payload.bin file decryptor, a .pac file decryptor, and a full on guide how to root your phone.

Keep in mind that those are just the early stages of my rooting guide, so it will take some time for it to be really useful :)
I dont get paid to do this so yeah.
